Rocket Software
=======================

Goals
-----
We want the rocket software to do the following:
- Measure the altitude of the rocket.
- Deploy a parachute soon after rocket apogee.
- Take pictures/video during flight.

Plan
----
We're going to put a Raspberry Pi in the rocket to run the software.  Since this is noderockets, we'll be using nodejs on the Raspberry Pi to measure the altitude and deploy the parachute.

The Software
------------
The software can be found at https://github.com/noderockets/noderocket-rocket.  Instructions on how to install and configure the software are on the project page.
