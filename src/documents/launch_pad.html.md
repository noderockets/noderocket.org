The Launch Pad
==============

Every good rocket launch starts with a good launch pad.

Goals
-----

Your launch pad needs to accomplish a few simple things:

1. Support the rocket - keep in mind how tall and how heavy your rocket will
 be as you design your launch pad.
2. Restrain the rocket - as soon as you start to pressurize your rocket,
it will want to leap off the pad, so you need a way to hold it down until you
 are ready to launch.
3. Release - When you are ready to launch, you will need a way to detach your
 restraints and let the rocket go.

As long as you accomplish these goals, you have a lot of flexibility in how
you design your base platform.

### Launcher Base

This tutorial gives a step by step of one example of a launch platform.

** Parts List **

Here's a list of the basic parts you'll need to build this version:
- (4) 8" lengths of 1" PVC
- (2) 4" lengths of 1" PVC
- (2) 1"x1"x1" PVC Tees
- (1) 1"x1"x1/2" PVC Tee - the 1/2" connection should be threaded
- (1) 1" PVC coupler
- (3) 1" PVC end caps
- (1) 1" to 1/2" PVC bushing
- (1) 1/2" to 1/4" bushing (I couldn't find PVC with 1/4" threads,
so I used brass)
- (1) Male air hose quick coupler
- PVC cement
- Teflon tape

The tools you'll need will vary, depending on your approach,
but you'll at least need something to cut the PVC with,
and probably a wrench to tighten the threaded fittings.
Also, it's probably a good idea to dry fit all your PVC components before you
start
 gluing.

** Steps **

1. Insert the two 4" lengths of 1" PVC in either end of the PVC Tee with the
1/2" threads:
![assembly step one](/images/launch-pad/02_assembly.JPG)
2. Now add the other two PVC Tees to the assembly:
![assembly step two](/images/launch-pad/03_assembly.JPG)
3. And now the 8" lengths of PVC pipe:
![assembly step three](/images/launch-pad/04_assembly.JPG)
4. Now you need to add end caps so this assembly will hold air.  The three
PVC end caps block three of our openings:
![end caps](/images/launch-pad/05_end_caps.JPG)
5. For the final opening, we fill that with the PVC bushing.  This allows us
to attach an air hose coupler with ease:
![PVC bushing](/images/launch-pad/06_pvc_bushing.JPG)
6. Once all the above fittings are glued and dried, you can attach the brass
bushing for the air hose connector.  Most air hose adaptors use 1/4"
connections.  If you can find PVC with 1/4" threads,
you can save a piece here, otherwise, use a black iron or brass bushing as I
have here.  Wrap the threads in Teflon tape, and thread the brass bushing
into the PVC.  Then wrap the threads of the air adaptor and thread it into
the bushing:

### Retention/Release Mechanism

This is certainly the most complicated part of any water rocket launcher.
The key is to be able to hold the rocket in place with a relatively air-tight
 seal, until you are ready to launch.  And then easily let go so the rocket
 can leave with as little resistance as possible.  The mechanism used here is
 known as the Clark Cable Tie method.  It is fairly easy to build and very
 reliable.

** Parts List **

- (1) 1/2" x 18"-long sprinkler riser
- (1) 1/2" x 4" long riser
- (1) 1/2" threaded coupler
- (12) - 8" or 11" zip ties
- (1 or 2) Medium sized hose clamp
- (1) 13/16" OD x 5/8" ID x 3/32" O-ring
- (1) 1.25" PVC coupler
- Duct tape

** Steps **

1. Start by laying a strip of duct tape upside down.  Use a strip that is
about 8" long.  I like to tape the ends of the tape to the bench so it won't
curl up or slide around.
![Upside down tape](/images/launch-pad/09_tape.JPG)
2. Take a cable tie and tape it perpendicular to your strip of tape somewhere
 in the middle of the strip.  Make sure the bump of the connector end of the
 tie is facing up.  How high to extend the tie above the tape is a matter of
 trial and error.  In this case I have it extending 1.25" above the tape.
![Upside down tape](/images/launch-pad/10_first_tie.JPG)
3. Now continue laying all the ties next to each other.  Make sure they are
even at the top and parallel to each other.  In this case I've added enough
to go around a bottle without a break.  You can space them further and use
fewer ties, but this works.
![All ties in place](/images/launch-pad/11_ties.JPG)
4. Take the 4" sprinkler riser and thread it into the 1/2" threaded coupler.
![First riser](/images/launch-pad/12_nipple.JPG)
5. Now cut the ends of the tape where you taped them to the table (this is a
lot easier than trying to pull off the strips of tape you used to hold it to
the table), and carefully wrap the zip ties around the riser and coupler.  If
 you extended your ties 1.25" above the tape like I did,
 line up the edge of the tape exactly with the edge of the top of the
 threaded coupler, like you see in the picture:
![Wrapping the ties](/images/launch-pad/13_taping_ties.JPG)
6. Use the remainder of your duct tape by wrapping it tightly around the ties
 several times.  You can cut a few more lengths of tape and continue wrapping
 down to the bottom of the riser.
![Wrapping the tape](/images/launch-pad/14_wrapping_tape.JPG)
7. Once the tape is wrapped tightly, use some wire cutters or scissors to
remove the bottoms of the ties that extend past the threads of the riser.
Your final product should look something like this:
![Wrapping complete](/images/launch-pad/15_wrapped.JPG)
8. Now take your hose clamps and tighten them firmly around the wrapped ties
on the riser.  You can then thread the riser into the base.  The bumps on the
 ties will hold the lip around the neck of a 2-liter bottle:
![riser mounted on the base](/images/launch-pad/16_ties_complete.JPG)
9. The 1.25" coupler slides over the zip ties.  This can be raised into place
 when the bottle is on the launcher to hold the ties closed around the lip of
 the bottle.  A section of bottle makes a nice spring to hold the coupler in
 place until the bottle is pressurized.  You'll want to drill a small hole in
 one end of the coupler so you can tie a string to it to use to pull it down
 for a launch.

** The launch tube **

Now that we have the ties in place to hold the rocket down,
we need a launch tube that will align the bottle with the ties and keep the
water from leaking out.  The method we are going to use here involves a
longer sprinkler riser with a shallow groove cut in it to hold an O-ring.
This is a fairly simple method, but making the groove can be difficult
without the right tools.

1. Take your 18" riser and cut it so when you slide a bottle down over the
riser, the end comes an inch or so shy of the bottom of the bottle.  In my
case, I ended up cutting the riser at almost exactly 10".
2. I'm using a table saw to cut the groove.  I raised the blade to just a
hair over 1/16".  It may be best to start with a shallower cut and make
repetitive cuts, raising the blade a hair each time, until you get a fit that
 allows you to slide the bottle over the O-ring with just a bit of pressure.
![The saw blade](/images/launch-pad/17_saw_blade.JPG)
3. I set the fence so the blade cuts the pipe a little over 1/4" from the end
 of the threads on the end.  I then use my miter gauge to keep the pipe
 perpendicular to the blade, and after sliding the pipe over the highest
 point of the blade I slowly rotate it, taking great care to keep the end
 pushed tightly against the fence.  Note that I'm using a thin kerf saw
 blade, which will cut a groove just a hair wider than my O-ring.  A regular
 saw blade might cut a groove that is too wide.
![cutting the groove](/images/launch-pad/18_cutting_groove.JPG)
4. Place the O-ring around the pipe and roll it into the groove.
5. Thread the riser into the coupler with the zip-ties.


Other Options
-------------

There are lots of ways to build a base for your launcher.  Because PVC pipe
and fittings are so common and easy to work with, there are many variations
of launcher base that will work great.

** Base Variations **

Here's an example of a base that uses the Clark Cable-Tie method on a "U"
shaped base using 2" PVC:
![U-shaped launcher #1](/images/launch-pad/23_gabes1.JPG)
![U-shaped launcher #2](/images/launch-pad/24_gabes2.JPG)

And another example made from a single 2" PVC Tee with a simple wooden base:
![Wooden base](/images/launch-pad/21_gardena2.JPG)

** Release Mechanism Variations **

Another area where you can be creative is the retention/release mechanism you
 use.  There are a variety of quick-release garden hose adaptors that seem
 ideal for this job.  This launcher uses a small PVC base mounted in some
 wooden blocks for stability, with a small Gardena quick-release adapter
 mounted on top:
![Gardena](/images/launch-pad/22_gardena3.JPG)

Of course, the quick release can be mounted on any base.  The only additional
parts you would need to put a quick release on the launcher base we built
above would be:
- a threaded adapter to convert from the 1/2" Tee we mounted the riser on to
a 3/4" male pipe thread.
- An inline check valve - This keeps the water from flowing from the rocket
back into our air source.  The one used here has standard female pipe threads
 on either end.
- a 3/4" pipe thread to male garden thread adapter.
- the garden hose quick release.
- springs, zip ties, and a hose clamp to pull down the quick release.
- some washers to hold up the quick release
- some string to pull out the washers

The detail photo below shows how it is all assembled:
![Gardena launcher detail](/images/launch-pad/20_gardena1.JPG)

Note that the springs continually pull the release down,
while the washers hold it up in the locked position.  Releasing the rocket is
 as simple as pulling the washers out.
